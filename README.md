- A clean and responsive user interface.

## Usage

In the `App.js` file, you can customize the accordion sections by adding or modifying the `<AccordionProps>` components. Each component represents a single accordion section and takes the following props:

- `title`: The title of the accordion section.
- `desc`: The description or content of the section.
- `active`: The currently active (open) section title.
- `setActive`: A function to set the active section.

```jsx
<AccordionProps 
  title='What crops are commonly grown in farming?' 
  desc='Corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans are some of the most common crops grown in farming. This varies with different locations and land.' 
  active={active} 
  setActive={setActive} 
/>
```

Feel free to add more sections or modify the existing ones according to your needs.
